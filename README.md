Interactive Storybook: This project helps understand the Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation and event handling. You'll dynamically create and modify HTML elements in response to user interactions, navigating through different parts of the story.

Pomodoro Timer: This project will help you grasp JavaScript's timing functions like setTimeout and setInterval. You'll also gain experience with updating the DOM in real-time and handling user interactions.

Slideshow Generator: Create an application where users can upload images to generate a slideshow. Concepts Covered: File API to handle file uploads, and CSS transitions for slideshow effects.

Collaborative Whiteboard: Build an application that allows multiple users to draw on a shared canvas in real-time. Concepts Covered: WebSocket for real-time communication, Canvas API for drawing functionality.

Mood Tracker: Develop an application that allows users to track their mood over time and visualize the data. Concepts Covered: Local Storage to persist data, date functions to handle entries, and a library like Chart.js to visualize data.

Typing Speed Tester: You'll handle string operations and timing events. It gives you a chance to calculate words per minute, a common operation when dealing with text in JavaScript.

Interactive Quiz Game: Create an interactive quiz game with multiple choice questions and real-time score tracking. Concepts Covered: Array manipulation to manage questions, and timer functions to limit time per question.

Star Rating System: This project involves handling mouse events and manipulating CSS classes or styles. You'll update the display based on user interaction, and perhaps save the rating for each item in local storage.

Canvas Drawing Application: You'll be using the HTML Canvas API, allowing users to draw shapes in a 2D drawing context. This requires handling mouse events and updating the canvas in response.

Real-Time Chat Application: This project provides experience with WebSockets for real-time communication between the client and the server. It's a more advanced project, but will give you a good understanding of how real-time web applications work.
